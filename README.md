# Reactjs-2024
# 2)
- React is a library.
- React is to used when we have complex frontend e.g. on 1 click changes takes place in 4-5 places.
- most project don't need react in initial phase
# why react was introduced:
- due to phantom read problem:
i.e. state->js & UI -> DOM and there was syncing problem between js and dom which leads to inconsistency.
- browser only understands html,css and js so react code is converted to them.

- npm-->node package manager -->installer of libraries.
- npx-->node package executer -->only to execute not install.
- - npx create-react-app 01basicreact -->to run react project-->slow.
